Quick Sort / Merge Sort / External Sort


Heap:
  Heapify写法  - worst case O(n)
  重载 __cmp__ 写法
  极大操作的 time complexity
  
  Sliding window Median (Heap) - Median of 2 sorted lists - Recursion
  LRU Cache
  LFU Cache
  
  
Stack:
  Largest Rectangle in histogram
  Max Tree / Min Tree
  Basic Calculator (Reverse Polish Expression)


Trie: 
  Trie 与 Hashtable查找的时间复杂度是一样的， 都是O(len(word))
  Trie 优于 HashTable的地方在于节约空间
  Trie 删除比较麻烦所以一般不删除
  应用：一个一个字母查找看这个 string 在不在字典里：Word Search I+II

Deque:
  Moving Average of Data Stream
  Max Sliding Window
  K largest Element - Quick Select
  Top K frequent element
  


* Median of 2 sorted lists (Recursion)
* K largest Element of unsorted list - Quick Select

* Moving Average of Data Stream (Deque)
* Max in Sliding Window (Deque)
* Sliding window Median (Heap)
* Top K frequent element (Heap)
