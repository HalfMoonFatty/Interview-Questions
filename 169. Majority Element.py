class Solution(object):
    def majorityElement(self, nums):

        candidate = nums[0]
        count = 0
        for elem in nums:
            if candidate == elem:
                count += 1
            else:
                if count == 0:
                    candidate = elem
                    count += 1
                else:
                    count -= 1
        return candidate
