Problem:

    Follow up for "Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array":
    What if duplicates are allowed?
    Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

    Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
    (i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).
    Find the minimum element.
    The array may contain duplicates.

Solution: 

For case where AL == AM == AR, the minimum could be on AMâ€™s left or right side (eg, [1, 1, 1, 0, 1] or [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]). 
In this case, we could not discard either subarrays and therefore such worst case degenerates to the order of O(n).
