Problem:

Given an integer array nums, return the number of range sums that lie in [lower, upper] inclusive.
Range sum S(i, j) is defined as the sum of the elements in nums between indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.

Note:
A naive algorithm of O(n2) is trivial. You MUST do better than that.

Example:
Given nums = [-2, 5, -1], lower = -2, upper = 2,
Return 3.
The three ranges are : [0, 0], [2, 2], [0, 2] and their respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.

Solution:

- count[i] = count of a <= S[j] - S[i] <= b with j > i ==> a + S[i] <= S[j] <= b + S[i] with j > i 
- ans = sum(count[:])

so for each prefix "p" need to add "p+lower" and "p+upper" to the index dictionary which is the sum range. 
But only add prefix to the BIT, as you only want to have a <= S[j] - S[i] <= b (i,j) pairs, not include the range.
