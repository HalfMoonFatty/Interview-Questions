Problem: Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it.

    For example,
    path = "/home/", => "/home"
    path = "/a/./b/../../c/", => "/c"

Corner Cases:
    - Did you consider the case where path = "/../"?
      In this case, you should return "/".
    - Another corner case is the path might contain multiple slashes '/' together, such as "/home//foo/".
      In this case, you should ignore redundant slashes and return "/home/foo".
